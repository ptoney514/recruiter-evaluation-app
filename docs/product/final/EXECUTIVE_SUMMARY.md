# Executive Summary - Resume Scanner Pro: Collaborative Resume Assistant

**Version:** 3.0 FINAL | **Date:** 2025-11-02 | **Status:** Production-Ready Specification

---

## The Critical Discovery

A senior recruiter tested our AI tool. Her reaction revealed the fatal flaw in every AI screening product:

**Before feedback capability:**
- Skeptical of AI rankings, even when accurate
- One AI mismatch = complete loss of trust
- Saw tool as "trying to replace me"

**After adding feedback/re-ranking:**
- Attitude transformed completely
- Went from skeptical to engaged
- Tool became "collaborative assistant"

**Her conclusion:**
> "I need to be able to teach the AI what matters for MY team. The feedback loop isn't optional - it's what makes AI trustworthy."

---

## Final Product Positioning

**OLD (Failed):** "AI screens resumes faster than humans"
**NEW (Validated):** "Teach the AI what great looks like for YOUR team"

**Resume Scanner Pro** is the only AI recruiting tool where the recruiter stays in control. Upload resumes, review AI rankings, provide quick feedback on 2-3 candidates, and watch the AI re-rank based on YOUR expertise in 15 seconds. The tool gets smarter every time you use it.

### Tagline
"Human + AI > Either Alone"

## Pricing Model (Final)

### Free Tier (Generous but Capped)
**Purpose:** Small teams might never upgrade - that's OK! Low CAC ($0.45 total AI cost)

**Limits:**
- 3 AI-powered jobs EVER (not active, total)
- 50 AI runs per job (150 total)
- Unlimited regex-only jobs (no AI cost)
- All collaborative features (notes, rerun, export)
- 50 candidates per run max

**Economics:**
- CAC: 150 runs × $0.003 = $0.45
- If 10% convert to Pro: $49 / 10 = $4.90 > $0.45 CAC ✅
- Generous enough to prove value
- Clear upgrade path for power users

### Pro Tier ($49/month)
**Purpose:** High margin, targets agencies + high-volume recruiters

**Includes:**
- Unlimited AI jobs
- Unlimited runs
- 200 candidates per run max
- Smart rerun optimization (auto-skip low-ranked)
- Premium exports (hiring manager reports)
- Interview guide generation
- Priority support

**Economics:**
- Revenue: $49/month
- Typical usage: 200 runs/month = $0.60 AI cost
- **Gross margin: 98.8%**
- Break-even: 16,333 runs/month (impossible to hit)

**Why Premium Pricing Works:**
- Feedback loop = differentiator (not commodity AI)
- Senior recruiters have budget authority
- $49/mo = hiring ONE better candidate worth $50k+ (0.1% improvement = 10x ROI)
- Clear positioning: "Collaborative AI is premium"

## Product Architecture

### Job-Centric Mental Model

**Problem Solved:** Recruiters think in "requisitions", not "batches"

**Structure:**
```
Job (Container)
├── Metadata (title, requirements, status)
├── Candidates (10-200 per job)
│   ├── Resume text + file
│   ├── AI evaluation (if AI mode)
│   ├── Status (pending/shortlisted/finalist/hired/rejected)
│   └── Notes (recruiter context)
├── Evaluation Runs (version history)
│   ├── Run 1: Initial upload (50 candidates)
│   ├── Run 2: Rerun with notes (10 candidates)
│   └── Run 3: New candidates added (5 candidates)
└── Usage Tracking (runs used, cost, tier limits)
```

**Benefits:**
- Natural return workflow (open job, continue where left off)
- Full audit trail (every evaluation saved)
- Usage-based pricing alignment (jobs + runs)
- Matches recruiter mental model perfectly

---

### Two-Track Evaluation Architecture

**Track 1: Regex-Only (FREE)**
```
Upload resumes → Extract text → Keyword matching → Score (0-100) → Rank → Export
```

**Features:**
- Fast (<5s for 50 resumes)
- Keyword highlighting
- Full UI (notes, status, export)
- Zero AI cost

**Limitations:**
- No reasoning/context
- No re-ranking with notes
- Simple keyword matching only

**Track 2: AI-Powered (3 FREE, then PAID)**
```
Upload resumes → Extract text → Claude Haiku evaluation → Score + reasoning → Rank → Notes → Rerun → Export
```

**Features:**
- Contextual reasoning
- Re-ranking with recruiter feedback
- Smart rerun logic
- Interview guide generation
- Premium exports

**Cost:**
- Initial: $0.003/candidate
- Rerun: $0.003/candidate (only shortlisted + annotated)

**Upgrade Path:**
- Regex job can be converted to AI job later
- "See AI analysis" button on regex results
- Side-by-side comparison

---

### Collaborative Feedback Architecture

**Selective Annotation (Not Systematic Review)**

**Key insight:** Recruiters don't review ALL candidates - they spot 1-2 standouts with insider context.

**Flow:**
1. AI ranks 50 candidates
2. Recruiter scans list (2 minutes)
3. Spots 2-3 candidates with context:
   - "This person worked here - red flag"
   - "Job title inflated - was IC level"
   - "Cultural fit concern from previous interaction"
4. Adds quick inline notes (always visible text field)
5. Clicks "Rerun Ranking" (grayed out until notes added)
6. AI re-evaluates with recruiter context (only shortlisted + annotated)
7. Updated ranking appears (<15s)

**Sometimes zero feedback:** Accept AI ranking, move to shortlist, export PDF.

---

## Smart Rerun Logic (Cost Optimization)

### Conservative Approach (Production-Ready)

**Only rerun:**
1. All shortlisted candidates (recruiter flagged these as interesting)
2. Any candidate with new notes since last run (recruiter added context)

**Don't rerun:**
- Low-ranked candidates (<70 score) without notes (waste of tokens)
- Already-rejected candidates without new context
- Candidates with no changes since last run

**Example:**
- Job has 50 candidates
- 10 shortlisted
- Recruiter adds notes to 2 (one shortlisted, one not)
- Rerun evaluates: 10 shortlisted + 1 new note = **11 candidates**
- Cost: 11 × $0.003 = **$0.033**

**Savings vs. full rerun:**
- Full: 50 × $0.003 = $0.15
- Smart: 11 × $0.003 = $0.033
- **Savings: 78%**

---

### AI-Suggested Shortlist Tiers

**After initial run, system suggests:**
- ✅ **Strong Candidates (10)** - Scores 85-95, recommend interview
- 🟡 **Maybe Candidates (8)** - Scores 70-84, consider phone screen
- ❌ **Not Recommended (32)** - Scores <70, missing key requirements

**Smart default:** "Move Strong to Shortlist" button
- Creates shortlist of 10
- Future reruns only process those 10
- Saves tokens naturally
- Forces intentional decision ("Do I agree with AI's strong tier?")

---

## Reuse 80% of Existing Code

### Already Built (No Changes)
- Python serverless functions (Vercel)
- Claude 3.5 Haiku API integration
- PDF parsing (pdfplumber)
- Multi-LLM support (Anthropic + OpenAI)
- Stage 1 evaluation logic
- React 18 + Vite frontend
- Tailwind UI components
- Supabase database (partial)

### Net New (20% Effort)
- Job-centric UI (dashboard, job detail)
- Two-track mode selection
- Tier limit tracking
- Inline notes UI
- Smart rerun logic
- Shortlist tier suggestions

**Total Effort:** 20 days (4 weeks) to production-ready MVP

## Cost Analysis & Unit Economics

### Free Tier Economics

**Assumptions:**
- Avg user creates 2 AI jobs
- Avg 25 candidates per job
- Avg 2 runs per job (initial + 1 rerun)

**Costs:**
- 2 jobs × 25 candidates × 2 runs × $0.003 = **$0.30 CAC**

**Conversion:**
- If 15% convert to Pro at $49/mo
- Revenue per signup: $49 × 0.15 = **$7.35**
- LTV (6 months): $49 × 6 × 0.15 = **$44.10**
- **LTV:CAC ratio = 147:1** ✅

### Pro Tier Economics

**Assumptions:**
- Pro user creates 8 AI jobs/month
- Avg 30 candidates per job
- Avg 2.5 runs per job (initial + 1.5 reruns)

**Costs:**
- 8 jobs × 30 candidates × 2.5 runs × $0.003 = **$1.80/month**

**Margins:**
- Revenue: $49/month
- AI cost: $1.80/month
- Supabase: $0.50/month (est)
- Vercel: $0.30/month (est)
- **Total COGS: $2.60/month**
- **Gross margin: 94.7%** ✅

### Break-Even Analysis

**Pro tier break-even:**
- Revenue: $49/month
- Fixed costs: $2.60/month (Supabase + Vercel)
- Variable cost: $0.003/candidate evaluation
- Break-even: (49 - 2.60) / 0.003 = **15,467 evaluations/month**

**Reality check:**
- Typical Pro usage: 600 evaluations/month
- Typical Pro cost: $1.80 + $2.60 = $4.40/month
- **We'd need 25x typical usage to break even** ✅

**Conclusion:** Economics work even with generous free tier.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Users don't provide feedback** | Critical | Medium | Inline notes (not modal), show value immediately, cost preview |
| **Smart rerun logic incorrect** | High | Low | Conservative rules (shortlisted + annotated), test extensively |
| **Free tier too generous** | Medium | Low | 150 runs = $0.45 CAC, LTV:CAC = 147:1, economics still work |
| **Tier limits confuse users** | Medium | Medium | Visual progress bars, clear warnings at 40/50, upgrade CTAs |
| **Regex vs AI not clear** | Medium | Medium | Side-by-side comparison, "Try AI" button on regex results |
| **Rerun too slow (>15s)** | High | Low | Claude Haiku (fast), parallel processing, only process 10-15 candidates |
| **Job-centric model doesn't fit** | High | Low | Matches recruiter mental model (validated with user research) |
| **Two-stage workflow too complex** | Medium | Low | Ship Stage 1 only for MVP, Stage 2 deferred to Week 5-6 |

**Overall Risk:** LOW
- Proven tech stack (Claude, Supabase, React)
- 80% code reuse (incremental changes)
- User-validated positioning (feedback loop)
- Conservative free tier (economics work even if generous)

---

## Rollback Plan

**If feedback engagement rate <50% after beta:**

### Option 1: Simplify Feedback (Keep Positioning)
- Remove rerun button (too intimidating?)
- Keep inline notes (passive feedback)
- Show notes in export only
- Defer re-ranking to future release

### Option 2: Revert to Basic AI (Abandon Collaborative Positioning)
- Keep AI ranking as-is
- Remove feedback/rerun features
- Position as "Fast AI screening"
- Focus on speed/cost vs. collaboration

### Option 3: Double Down on Selective Annotation
- Simplify to thumbs up/down only
- Remove reason codes (too much friction?)
- Show "Your picks" vs "AI picks" side-by-side
- No re-ranking, just comparison

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Feedback engagement rate <50% after 100 evaluation runs
- Smart rerun logic fails (processes wrong candidates >10% of time)
- Performance issues (rerun >30 seconds consistently)
- Beta testers prefer basic AI over collaborative model

**Cost:** 4 weeks engineering (sunk cost if rollback needed)
