## 💡 Key Insights (TL;DR)

### The Discovery
A senior recruiter tested our AI tool. Her reaction revealed the fatal flaw in every AI screening product:

> "I was skeptical of AI rankings until I could provide feedback and see re-ranking. One AI mismatch destroyed trust. Being able to add context like 'worked with her before' and see updated ranking transformed me from skeptical to engaged."

**Conclusion:** The feedback loop isn't optional - it's the trust mechanism that makes AI acceptable.

---

### Final Product Model

**Positioning:** "Teach the AI what great looks like for YOUR team"

**Architecture:**
1. **Job-Centric** - Organize by requisition, not pile of resumes
2. **Two-Track** - FREE regex forever, AI-powered (3 jobs FREE then $49/mo)
3. **Collaborative** - Inline notes → Smart rerun → Updated rankings
4. **Cost-Optimized** - Smart rerun processes 10-15 candidates (not 50), saves 78%

**Pricing:**
- **Free Tier:** 3 AI jobs (150 runs), unlimited regex, all features
- **Pro Tier:** $49/mo, unlimited AI jobs/runs, 95% gross margin

**Timeline:** 4 weeks to beta-ready MVP (80% code reuse)

**Economics:** 147:1 LTV:CAC, 95% gross margin, break-even at 15k+ runs/month (impossible to hit)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### One Metric That Matters
**Feedback Engagement Rate = 80%**

### Supporting KPIs
- **D7 Retention:** 50%

- Complete <15 seconds (P95)
- Cost <$0.05 per rerun
- 95%+ accuracy (no missed candidates)

### 3. Tier Limits Must Drive Upgrades
- Visual progress bars (always visible)
- Early warnings (at 40/50, not 49/50)
- Clear value proposition (why upgrade?)
- Soft nudges (not hard blocks until necessary)

### 4. Positioning Must Be Consistent

## 🚧 Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Users don't provide feedback | Critical | Medium | Inline notes (not modal), show value immediately, cost preview |
| Smart rerun logic incorrect | High | Low | Conservative rules (shortlisted + annotated), test extensively |
| Free tier too generous | Medium | Low | 150 runs = $0.45 CAC, LTV:CAC = 147:1, economics still work |
| Tier limits confuse users | Medium | Medium | Visual progress bars, clear warnings, upgrade CTAs |
| Rerun too slow (>15s) | High | Low | Claude Haiku (fast), parallel processing, only 10-15 candidates |
