## Declined Candidates - Summary Rationales

### 6. Anna Muenchen (Score: 68) - DECLINE
**Rationale**: Does NOT meet minimum qualification requirement. While she has excellent campus ministry experience at Rockhurst University (Jesuit), she does not possess a Master's degree in theology, divinity, pastoral studies, ministry, or related field. Resume shows she is currently pursuing M.A. in Organizational Leadership - not the required field. Job description lists Master's in theology/ministry as REQUIRED, not preferred.

**Strength**: Her Rockhurst experience with college students would otherwise make her a competitive candidate.

---

### 7. Alex Camama (Score: 62) - DECLINE
**Rationale**:
- International candidate currently in the Philippines - H-1B visa sponsorship likely required
- Master's degree appears incomplete based on resume presentation
- Potential English language proficiency concerns for ministry requiring extensive verbal pastoral care
- No U.S. higher education or campus ministry experience

---

### 8. Steven Smith (Score: 60) - DECLINE
**Rationale**: Does NOT meet faith requirement. Candidate is a Baptist ordained minister. Job description requires "practicing member of the Catholic faith" and knowledge of "Ignatian spirituality and Jesuit charism." While he has extensive and impressive chaplaincy credentials (BCC, CPE Supervisor, 20+ years experience), he does not meet the fundamental Catholic faith requirement.

---

### 9. Patricia Mac Bride Olsen (Score: 50) - DECLINE
**Rationale**: Does NOT meet minimum qualification requirement.
- Education: B.A. in Marketing - no Master's degree in required field
- Experience: Background in fundraising, development, and stewardship - not pastoral ministry
- Resume shows institutional advancement work, not campus ministry or pastoral care

---
